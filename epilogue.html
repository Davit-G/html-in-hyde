  <h1>Epilogue</h1>
  <h2>What?</h2>
  HTML in Hyde is a <i>HTML Freewrite</i> - <q>[an event] in which people get together and write HTML documents</q>.
  <a href="https://html.energy/events.html">events - html energy</a> lists similar events all around the world, like the Ontario based <a href="https://html.green/">HTML in the Park</a>! 
  
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  Ask a mid-20s software engineer "why did you start coding?" - a non-trivial amount will say "I was trying to make my Tumblr look cool".
  <br />
  If they're a bit older, they might say Myspace. Older still, Geocities.
  <br />
  I feel like that there's a prevailing nostalgia for an earlier internet, where people had their own little space that they could express themselves creatively.
  <br />

  <h3>New developments</h3>
  Fortunately, there's a growing community of people who share this nostalgia.
  <br />
  <a href="https://diagram.website/">Diagram Website - An internet map</a> has attempted to paint a picture of this community (which is, unsurprisingly, quite decentralized). Its broad categorizations are:
