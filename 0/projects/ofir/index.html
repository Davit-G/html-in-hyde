            The National Rugby League (NRL) is the top league of professional rugby league clubs in Australasia. 
            The NRL was formed in the aftermath of the 1990s' Super League war as a joint partnership between the 
            Australian Rugby League (ARL) and News Corporation-controlled Super League, after both organizations 
            ran parallel competitions in 1997.
